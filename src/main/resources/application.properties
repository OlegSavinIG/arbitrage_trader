Looking at your code, I've found some issues that need to be fixed. Let me analyze the code and provide corrections.

Issues and Fixes
Issue 1: Incorrect API Endpoint Path
Your CoincapPriceService is using the CoinMarketCap API endpoint, but the service name suggests CoinCap. These are different services, and your implementation is actually for CoinMarketCap.

Issue 2: Token Symbol Format and Handling
The way you're extracting symbols and handling token pairs is inconsistent with CoinMarketCap's API requirements.

Issue 3: Response Parsing
The error handling in your JSON parsing needs improvement to better handle API responses.

Issue 4: Security Concern
Your API key is exposed in the application.properties file, which is not secure for production environments.

Corrected Code

Corrected CoinMarketCapPriceService.java
Code
Explanation
Service Renaming: I've renamed the service from CoincapPriceService to CoinMarketCapPriceService to correctly reflect that you're using the CoinMarketCap API (based on the endpoint URL and API key header).
Improved Error Handling: The error handling in the response parsing is now more robust, with better checks for the status code and error messages from the API.
Better Logging: I've enhanced the logging throughout the service to provide more context about what's happening, especially during errors.
Empty Stream Handling: Added a check in getPriceStream() to return an empty flux when a token isn't found, preventing potential null pointer exceptions.
Configuration Security: Regarding your API key in application.properties - I'd recommend using environment variables or a secure vault for storing sensitive information instead of hardcoding it in configuration files.
WebClient Configuration: Your CoinWebClientConfiguration looks good, with appropriate timeout settings.
Additional Recommendations
Consider Rate Limiting: CoinMarketCap API has rate limits. You might want to implement retries with backoff or adjust your polling interval accordingly.
Error Recovery: Consider implementing a mechanism to recover if the API is temporarily unavailable.
Token List Management: Consider making the token list configurable through your application properties rather than hardcoding it.
Unit Tests: Add unit tests for your service, particularly focusing on error handling and response parsing.
Is there any specific part of the code you'd like me to explain in more detail?

I'll implement rate limiting with retries and backoff strategy for the CoinMarketCap API and also review your CoinWebClientConfiguration class.


CoinMarketCapPriceService with Rate Limiting and Retries
Code

Improved CoinWebClientConfiguration
Code

Updated application.properties with Rate Limiting Configuration
Code
Improvements and Explanations
1. Rate Limiting Implementation
I've enhanced the CoinMarketCapPriceService with rate limiting features:

API Call Counting: Tracks the number of API calls made within a minute
Rate Limit Check: Before making API calls, checks if we've exceeded the configured limit
Automatic Reset: Resets the counter after one minute passes
Configurable Limits: Rate limits can be configured in application.properties
2. Retry with Exponential Backoff
The service now includes a retry mechanism with exponential backoff:

Smart Retries: Only retries on specific error codes (429 Too Many Requests, 5xx Server Errors)
Exponential Backoff: Each retry waits longer than the previous one
Maximum Attempts: Configurable maximum number of retry attempts
Maximum Backoff: Configurable maximum wait time between retries
Detailed Logging: Logs each retry attempt for monitoring
3. Improved WebClient Configuration
I've enhanced the CoinWebClientConfiguration with several improvements:

Connection Pooling: Added connection pooling to efficiently manage connections
Configurable Timeouts: Both connection and read timeouts are now configurable
Memory Limit: Increased buffer size for handling larger API responses
Request/Response Logging: Added logging filters to monitor API interactions
Security: API key is masked in logs to prevent accidental exposure
Media Type Headers: Added proper Content-Type and Accept headers
4. Updated Application Properties
The application properties now include all necessary configuration parameters:

Environment Variables: Added support for API key via environment variable
Rate Limiting Settings: Configuration for the rate limiting mechanism
Connection Settings: Configuration for connection management
Memory Settings: Configuration for response buffer size
Best Practices Implemented
Security: API key is now configurable via environment variables
Resource Management: Added connection pooling to prevent connection exhaustion
Resilience: Added retry mechanism with backoff for transient failures
Rate Control: Implemented rate limiting to respect API constraints
Monitoring: Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
Performance: Optimized connection management and buffer sizes
Configurability: Made all important parameters configurable
These changes will make your application more robust when dealing with the CoinMarketCap API, especially under heavy load or when facing transient network issues.
